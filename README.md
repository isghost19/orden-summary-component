in the construction of the button I already have it more informed.

.btn button {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 14px 15px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    border: none;
    background-color: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
    color: white;
    width: 100%;
    -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 14px 20px -6px rgba(136,142,143,1);
    -moz-box-shadow: 0px 14px 20px -6px rgba(136,142,143,1);
    box-shadow: 0px 14px 20px -6px rgba(136,142,143,1);
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.4s ease;
}
.btn button:hover {
    background-color: hsla(245, 75%, 52%, 0.7);
}
```

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I find it easier to do this type of thing a component with content inside.
I'm still learning.
